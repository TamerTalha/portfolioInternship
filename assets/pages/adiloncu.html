            <p>
                Abdullah Adil Oncu is a game enthusiast studying ICT & Game Design at Fontys. I designed and developed a
                portfolio website for him to support his internship applications.</p>
            <a href="https://adiloncu.com/" target="_blank" class="blueLink">adiloncu.com<i>&#x2197;</i></a>
            <br>

            <h2>INTERVIEW</h2>
            <p>I interviewed Adil to get to know him and to understand what exactly he needs.
                <BR></BR>
                He mentioned that he needed a portfolio where he could display his past projects and experience.
                <br><br>
                After the interview, I told him that a website would be the best way to showcase his work. I gave him
                some options, and explained the benefits and drawbacks of all.
                <br><br>
                <b>Options:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Wix Website Builder</b></li>
                <li><b>Wordpress</b></li>
                <li><b>I will design and develop everything</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>He wanted to have flexibility with the design and help me with my learning outcomes. So, he decided to
                leave all the work to me :</p>
            </p>

            <h2>INSPIRATION</h2>
            <p>I browsed through portfolios of various game designers / developers and gathered screenshots of things I
                found cool. I also asked Adil to send me portfolio examples that he finds interesting.</p>
            <img src="./assets/img/inspirationAdilOncu.png" alt="">

            <h2>ANALYSE</h2>
            <p>After taking a look at several portfolios, I realized some common design choices in the structure. I
                noted the ones I thought would be useful in this project.
                <br><br>
                <b>Findings:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>The focus is on projects and not explaining who they are.</li>
                <li>People tell more about themselves at the bottom of the Home page.</li>
                <li>Show, don't tell. Use as many screenshots / recordings as possible.</li>
                <li>Link the products, game jam results, prizes, and code (GitHub).</li>
                <li>Show other study or work experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I decided to include projects, experience, and an about text on the Home page.
                <br><br>
                Also, I requested from Adil screenshots / recordings from all his games to display them in the process
                explanation of each project.
            </p>
            </p>

            <h2>DESIGN</h2>
            <p>The design of this project was inspired mostly from Tomas Wallin and Surya Narendran's portfolios.
                <br><br>
                Adil's website had to be responsive, so that he could show it to anyone he meets in expos, events, and
                career days. While designing, I always kept this fact in mind.
            </p>
            <h3>WIREFRAMES | LO-FI</h3>
            <p>I created wireframes that shows how each section will be displayed, both on mobile and desktop. </p>
            <img src="./assets/img/wireframeLoFiAdilOncu.png" alt="">

            <h3>PROTOTYPE | MID-FI</h3>
            <p>Before Adil sent the necessary content, images and videos, I made this mid-fidelity prototype using Shrek
                as placeholder.</p>
            <img src="./assets/img/prototypeMidFiAdilOncu.png" alt="">

            <h3>FEEDBACK</h3>
            <p>I presented the current situation to Adil, demoing the mid-fi prototype and asked for his opinion on the
                design.
                <br><br>
                He noted that I presented clearly and “convinced” him that this design was the best.
                <br><br>
                Initially, I had blue and red as accent colors. I changed that after Adil mentioned that he liked green
                and purple more.
            </p>

            <h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
            <p>I coded the website using HTML & CSS, taking responsiveness into consideration. I kept the code in
                <a href="https://github.com/TamerTalha/adilPortfolio" target="_blank"
                    class="blueLink">GitHub<i>&#x2197;</i></a>
                for version control. I wrote comments in the code for Adil to be able to edit things easily.
            </p>

            <h3>FEEDBACK</h3>
            <p>He told me that the code looks clean and understandable. He asked some small questions like “Can I use a
                gif instead of an image?”, and I answered them successfully.</p>
