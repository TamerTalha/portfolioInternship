                Board game is a board game where you try your best to fill your passport with stamps. I mostly worked on
                the development part of this project.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>INTERVIEW</h2>
            <p>We interviewed Petra & Maikel separately to find answers to our questions before starting with the
                project.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>QUESTIONS</h3>
            <p>Me and Kourosh prepared the questions by giving instant feedback to each other and choosing the necessary
                ones wisely.</p>

            <h3>ANSWERS</h3>
            <p>During the interview, I took notes from the answers given by Petra & Maikel. We also voice recorded the
                interviews (with their permission) to be able to go back and see if we missed any important point.
            </p>

            <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
            <p>I did an observation research during a board game event of Proxy study association. I was able to observe
                GenZ playing different board games. I focused on interactions, emotions, and mechanics. <BR><BR> Before
                the event, I created a template for myself to fill in that made it easier to take notes. In this
                template I included some questions and a table where i noted the events, reactions, and design ideas for
                the problems.</p>

            <h2>CONCEPT</h2>
            <p>The game concept is a chaotic twist on tradition: Pio-Pera uses reverse logic, absurd mechanics, and digital surprises to create joyful confusion and viral fun. Players move anti-clockwise, subtract dice rolls, and embrace nonsense as strategy. <BR><BR> Designed for a generation that lives on memes and ironic humor, every rule-break and bizarre moment is intentional. It's not about winning, it's about laughing.</p>

            <h2>DESIGN</h2>
            <p>We designed the board, currency, stickers, and stamps on our own which is one of the factors that makes this game unique.</p>
            
            <h3>BOARD</h3>

            <h3>CURRENCY</h3>

            <h3>STICKERS & STAMPS</h3>
            <img src="/assets/img/stickerStamps.png" alt="">

            <h2>PRODUCTION</h2>
            <h3>GAME COMPONENTS</h3>
            <p>We printed the board, currency, passport, stickers, and stamps from the sticker printer in R10. We glued the board to a cardboard, and packed the remaining components for easier transportation.</p>
            
            <h3>APP</h3>
            <p>I and Kourosh worked on the development of the app. We used React, Vite and IndexedDB to code this project. </p>

            <h2>USER TESTING</h2>
            <p>We user tested the our game in multiple events such as the Night of the Nerds. I was the responsible person to stay by our stand and explain the project to visitors in all events.
                <br><br>
                From the last user testing in the Night of the Nerds, we verified that the game has no major issues and is ready to be published.</p>
            <img src="/assets/img/userTesting.jpg" alt="">

            <h2>FEEDBACK</h2>
            <p>The teachers, assessors, and clients noted that the project is completed successfully, with a advice report provided for the client by our group.</p>
