                Slaygency (formerly Beyond) is a studio specializing in creating memorable products that will put a
                smile on people's faces. As a proud member of this group, I worked on the brand identity and graphic
                design of the project.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>INSPIRATION</h2>
            <p>Using the mind mapping method helped us define our mission as a studio. It also sparkled a name idea in
                my mind which actually became the name of our studio.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="/assets/img/inspirationSlaygency.png" alt="">

            <h3>MISSION</h3>
            <p>Our mission is to put a smile on people's faces. We do this by creating trendy and newer generational
                designs. Currently, focusing on GenZ trends, jokes, and memes.</p>

            <h3>NAME</h3>
            <p>A word used a lot by the newer generations, “Slay”. I was thinking of names that could include words like
                “Studio”, “Agency”, “GenZ”. Trying different combinations in my mind, I came up with the name Slaygency.
                <br><br>
                I proposed the name to my team and everyone agreed on it since it also sounds like “Slay Agency” or
                “Slay GenZ”.
            </p>

            <h3>MOODBOARD</h3>
            <p>To get an idea of what kind of designs we want to make and what kind of vibes we want to give to the
                clients, I created a mood board in which I included GenZ design trends and memes.</p>
            <img src="/assets/img/moodboardSlaygency.png" alt="">

            <h2>DESIGN</h2>
            <p>Being inspired from the mood boards, we make a stylescape, defining our colors, typography, and logo. I
                mainly worked on the typography and the logo iterations.</p>

            <h3>LOGO ITERATIONS</h3>
            <p>Here are some of the logo iterations I have made. The ones below are iterations on a logo made by my
                group mate Fabiana.</p>
            <img src="/assets/img/logosSlaygency.png" alt="">

            <h3>POSTER</h3>
            <p>I made a poster that represents us as a group. I used pop colors, one of the logo iterations, and photos
                of our group's members to make it memorable.</p>

            <h2>PRESENTATION</h2>
            <p>I had this idea of starting the presentation as “Beyond”, showcase the updates, then at some point just
                say “We thought this was boring, so we decided to re-brand!”. We did implement this idea, and it was
                liked a lot by the teachers and peers.
                <br><br>
                On the slides, we made sure to use our colors and humor. I worked on the following pages:

            <h2>PROJECT CHOICE</h2>
            <p>From client presentations, our favorite project was the Board Game project by Petra and Maikel. We had so
                much motivation and so many ideas going on that we stayed at school and discussed these ideas and wrote
                some down in order not to forget if we got the project.</p>
            <p>We got it!</p>
